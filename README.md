# Handwritten-digit-recognition

we have successfully built a Python deep learning project on handwritten digit recognition app. We have built and trained the Convolutional neural network which is very effective for image classification purposes. Later on, we build the GUI where we draw a digit on the canvas then we classify the digit and show the results.
